Hexadecimal color code generator and flipper.
Generator uses Math module to generate a random hex code given digits 1 - 9 & A - F.
Flipper selects a random hex code from an array of all the html5 color codes, although I have used a few of them
I did not get all the 256 color codes, especially in excel format.
